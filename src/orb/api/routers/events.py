"""Global Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint.

Provides a single persistent connection that the UI subscribes to once per page
load, receiving push deltas for machines, requests, templates, and heartbeats.

Wire protocol (standard SSE):
    event: <type>
    data: {"json": "..."}

    (blank line terminates each event)

Event types emitted:
    machine.created / machine.updated / machine.deleted
    request.created / request.updated / request.completed / request.failed
    template.created / template.updated / template.deleted
    heartbeat  — every 15 s, data: {"ts": "<ISO>"}

Query parameters:
    ?since=<ISO>        optional – replay events newer than this timestamp (best-effort)
    ?since_seq=<int>    optional – combined with ?since= to enable gap-detection.
                        When the server cannot fully serve the requested range
                        (oldest surviving history entry is newer than since_seq+1),
                        a synthetic sentinel event is emitted first:
                            event: replay_truncated
                            data: {"type": "replay_truncated", "since": <int>, "seq_id": 0}
                        seq_id 0 is reserved for this sentinel and is never issued by
                        the monotonic counter.  Clients receiving this sentinel should
                        treat their local state as stale and perform a full reload.
    ?type=<csv>         optional – comma-separated allow-list of event types

Architecture note:
    ORB has a synchronous handler-based EventBus that dispatches DomainEvents to
    pre-registered handler instances.  That bus does not support async fan-out to
    dynamic, per-request subscribers, so we layer a thin in-process pubsub on top:

        SseEventBus
         - global singleton (module-level)
         - each SSE connection gets its own asyncio.Queue
         - the SseEventHandler (registered with ORB's EventBus in
           bootstrap.core_services) awaits SseEventBus.publish() which
           enqueues to all live queues
         - SSE generator drains the queue and yields formatted lines

    Single-worker only: subscribers live in process memory, so events
    emitted in worker A never reach SSE clients on worker B. Run the
    API with --workers 1 if SSE clients are expected, or move pubsub to
    a shared transport (Redis pub/sub etc.) before scaling out.

           is empty (e.g. after a server restart).  The bus has no evidence
           that it ever issued ``since_seq``, so the client's claim is
           impossible to verify; treat it as a gap.

        the module-level counter.  Clients that receive this event should
        treat their local view as stale and perform a full reload.

        If ``since_seq == 0`` with an empty deque, or if the oldest entry's
