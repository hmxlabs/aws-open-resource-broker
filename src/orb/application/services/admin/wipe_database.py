    Deliberately avoids DROP / raw SQL so that schema migrations remain intact

    Uses the ``UnitOfWorkFactory`` rather than DI singleton repositories so the
    wipe targets the SAME storage instance the read/write paths use. Singleton
    repos are created with a ``generic`` entity_type bucket which doesn't
    match the per-entity buckets (``machines``/``requests``/``templates``) the
    UoW writes to — wiping via singletons silently no-ops on single-file
    JSON storage.

    Repositories wiped (in safe deletion order — children before parents):
      1. machines  — individual machine records
      2. requests  — request aggregates (machines reference requests)
      3. templates — template definitions

    Return requests are stored as Request aggregates with type RETURN so they
    are covered by the requests repository wipe.
