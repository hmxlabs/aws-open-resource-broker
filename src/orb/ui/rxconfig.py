"""Reflex configuration for the ORB UI (packaged copy).

This file ships inside the ``orb`` wheel at ``orb/ui/rxconfig.py`` so that
``reflex run`` can find it when the package is installed from PyPI.  The
embedded-UI runtime (``run_embedded_foreground``) sets ``cwd`` to the
directory that contains this file before exec-ing ``reflex run``.

A thin re-export at the repository root (``rxconfig.py``) delegates here so
that ``reflex run`` from the repo root continues to work for local
development.

Note: ``reflex`` is an optional dependency (the ``[ui]`` extra).  This
module must remain importable even when reflex is not installed so that
pyright and other static-analysis passes that run without the UI extra do
not raise ImportError.  The ``rx.Config`` block is only evaluated when
reflex is actually importable (i.e. at runtime with the [ui] extra or under
``reflex run``).

# Note: pass --no-ssr when running ``reflex run`` / ``reflex export``.
# The vaul drawer used in detail panels reads ``document`` at module
# scope and crashes the React-Router node-side prerender.  ``orb server
# start`` already passes this flag automatically when ``ui.enabled``.
