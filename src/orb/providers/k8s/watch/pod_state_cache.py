"""Thread-safe in-memory cache of pod state, keyed by ``(request_id, pod_name)``.

Populated by :class:`~orb.providers.k8s.watch.watcher.K8sWatcher`
and consumed by
:class:`~orb.providers.k8s.handlers.pod_handler.K8sPodHandler`
when the watcher task is alive.  When the cache returns ``None`` (cold
start, watcher dead, or stale entries) the handler falls back to a
scoped ``list_namespaced_pod`` call.

The cache stores the minimum information the Pod handler needs to compute
fulfilment without re-deriving fields from a ``V1Pod`` on every read:

* ``status``           — ORB status string (``"running"`` / ``"starting"`` /
  ``"pending"`` / ``"failed"``).  Produced from ``status.phase`` plus
  the readiness condition by the watcher's event-translator.
* ``phase``            — raw kubernetes ``status.phase`` for debugging.
* ``ready``            — whether the Ready condition is True.
* ``pod_ip`` / ``host_ip`` / ``node_name`` — convenient flattened
  attributes used by the per-instance status dict.
* ``status_reason``    — terminated/waiting container reason or
  ``PodScheduled=False`` reason.
* ``namespace``        — namespace the pod belongs to (so multi-namespace
  callers can recover it without re-listing).
* ``labels``           — frozen snapshot of the labels.
* ``deleted``          — ``True`` when the pod was observed via a
  ``DELETED`` watch event; the entry is retained briefly so concurrent
  status reads see the terminal state, then removed by
  :meth:`PodStateCache.delete`.
* ``last_updated``     — monotonic timestamp (seconds) of the last
  upsert; consumed by :meth:`PodStateCache.mark_stale`.
* ``disrupted_reason`` / ``disrupted_message`` — set when the pod
  carries a ``DisruptionTarget=True`` condition (Karpenter preemption).
  ``None`` when the pod is not being preempted.
* ``restart_count``    — sum of ``restartCount`` across all containers;
  non-zero values indicate a container restart loop and are surfaced in
  the per-instance ``provider_data`` so operators can detect
  ``CrashLoopBackOff`` before the pending timeout fires.

The cache uses a coarse :class:`threading.RLock` because the watcher
runs on a worker thread (via :func:`asyncio.to_thread`) while readers
run in the asyncio event loop.  Per-request reads are O(1) thanks to a
secondary index from ``request_id`` to its pod-name set.
