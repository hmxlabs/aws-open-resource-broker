"""kubeconfig-based Kubernetes config loader.

Thin wrapper around ``kubernetes.config.load_kube_config`` for the
out-of-cluster case.  Keeps the ``kubernetes`` SDK import confined to this
package and exposes a small, unit-testable seam.

Security hardening
------------------
Before delegating to the SDK, this module parses the kubeconfig with a
plain YAML load and inspects every user entry for ``exec:`` blocks.  An
``exec`` credential plugin executes an arbitrary binary on the local
machine; unknown binaries are blocked unless the operator has explicitly
set ``ORB_K8S_ALLOW_UNKNOWN_EXEC_PLUGIN=1``.  Well-known cloud-provider
auth plugins (``aws``, ``aws-iam-authenticator``, ``gke-gcloud-auth-plugin``,
``kubelogin``, ``azure-cli``) are allowed unconditionally.

Error messages emitted from the fallback ``except`` block are sanitised so
that raw SDK exception text (which may embed file contents) is never
forwarded to callers.  Only the config_file path and a coarse error
category are included.
