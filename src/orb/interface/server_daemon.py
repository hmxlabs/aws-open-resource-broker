"""Process-lifecycle primitives for ``orb server`` commands.

Posix-only. Implements start/stop/status/restart for the foreground
``server_runtime`` entrypoints. Responsibilities here:

  - Double-fork + ``setsid`` so the daemon detaches from the controlling
    terminal and survives shell exit
  - Redirect stdio to a rotating log file
  - Write a PID file guarded by ``fcntl.lockf`` so two starts can't race
  - Stop via SIGTERM → wait → SIGKILL fallback, killing the whole
    process group so the Reflex tree (Node included) goes down with us

The actual server work — uvicorn or ``reflex run`` — is delegated to
``server_runtime`` via a thin ``_run_in_loop`` helper. The daemon module
doesn't import uvicorn or Reflex at module scope.
