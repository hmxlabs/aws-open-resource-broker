"""Architecture test: ``kubernetes`` must not be imported outside the k8s
provider tree.

Importing the ``kubernetes`` SDK directly in core or infrastructure modules
couples the entire application to the ``[k8s]`` (or ``[k8s-legacy]``) extra
even when neither is installed.  All ``kubernetes`` SDK usage must be
confined to:

* ``src/orb/providers/k8s/``  — modern provider (TYPE-CHECKED)
* ``src/orb/k8s_legacy/``     — legacy plugin (maintenance mode, filtered
  globally via ``EXCEPTION_PATHS``)

Mirrors the ``boto3``/``botocore`` confinement test in
``test_boto3_leak_detection.py``.
