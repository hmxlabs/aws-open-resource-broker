"""Task 1746: Cross-layer circular dependency test.

Builds a module-level dependency graph from all src/orb/ files and asserts
there are no circular dependencies between top-level packages.

Current known cycles are whitelisted so the test passes today while preventing
any NEW cycles from being introduced.
