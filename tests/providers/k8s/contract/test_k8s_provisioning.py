"""K8s provisioning contract tests — inherits all scenarios from BaseProvisioningContract.

Group T5 note
-------------

The base contract's test_acquire_resource_ids_are_stable scenario calls
provider_under_test.acquire_hosts twice and asserts the returned resource_ids
differ between calls.  The k8s contract conftest uses a Python-level mock
whose _list_namespaced_pod implementation tracks deleted_pods state across both
acquire calls via a shared closure.  Because the pod name is derived from
request_id (e.g. orb-contractreq001-0000 vs orb-contractreq001b-0000), the two
calls naturally return different IDs and the assertion holds.

However, the shared mock state means a second acquire call would see stale
list results if the pod names happened to collide.  The overriding scenario
below replaces the shared adapter with two fresh, independent adapters — one
per acquire call — so the assertion is not contingent on the ordering of mock
side-effects.  Each adapter gets its own core_v1 mock with a clean deleted_pods
closure, removing the state-coupling between the two acquires.
